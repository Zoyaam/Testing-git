    A website, also written as <strong>Web site</strong>, <strong>web site</strong>, or simply <strong>site</strong>, is a set of related web pages served from a single web domain. A website is hosted on at least one web server,accesible via a network such as the internet or a private local area network through an internet address known as a <font color = "red" >Uniform Resource Locator</font>. All publicly accesible websites collectively constitute the <font color = "red">World Wibe Web</font>.
</p align = "justify">
    A webpage is a document, typically written in plain text interspersed with formatting instruction of <font color = "red">Hypertext Markup Language</font>(<font color = "green">HTML,XHTML</font>). A webpage may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable markup anchors.

<p align = "justify">
    Webpages are accessed and transported with the <font color="red">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</font>(<font color="green">HTTP</font>),which may optionally employ encryption (<font color="green">HTTP secure,HTTPS</font>) to provide security and privacy for the use of the webpage content. The user's application,often a web browser,renders the page content according to its HTML markup instruction onto a display terminal.
